Honeypot for POS skimmers/Scraping Malware

Description
Injects 1-5 False random CC numbers for every one legitimate CC number that is entered. In effect making stolen credit card batches harder to sell. 

This is a software for making credit cards numbers harder to steal in the methods that have been happening in larger breaches.

At this time I have working "Batch Software" For PMS or software that runs CC in audit batches.

Taking Requests for POS OS's at this time also

If your interested in project let me know.

Thanks
